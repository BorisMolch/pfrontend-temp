  - question: WHAT IS PATCH ?
    answer: Patch is a modular, immersive musical instrument environment made for
      Virtual Reality to code, create and connect your own instruments and sounds,
      and interact with them live with your body, your gestures, and other people.
      Our proprietary engine is written in C++ and we are using Unity 3D for the VR
      interface.
  - question: WHAT CAN I CREATE WITH PATCH?
    answer: 'Patch doesn’t just mimic existing musical instruments, it explores music
      beyond your average experience. Thanks to over four years of research and collaboration
      with XR artists, producers, musicians and audio engineers, Patch can create
      new, exiting hybrid creations and compositions that have never been seen before,
      and never been heard before. With Patch you can create interactive worlds, instruments,
      sound FX, automata, music games, perform live and stream online simultaneously,
      link VR machines and worlds to your existing workflow using OSC, MIDI, CV gate. '
  - question: WHY USE VR TO MAKE MUSIC?
    answer: Patch lets you interact spatially with visuals and sonic interactions
      that respond to where you’re looking and how you move - a full-body, full-sensory
      experience with spatial audio. It’s an immersive, inventive world to explore,
      rather than just another rectangular editing interface.
  - question: CAN I GET PATCH SOFTWARE?
    answer: Patch is not released yet, but we are giving some development licences
      to selected creators and universities. If you want to get a try, it's possible,
      just contact us by mail.
  - answer: 'We are currently developing PATCHWORLD, a gamified version of our tool.
      A fantasia like environment to experience with procedural sound in VR. Patchworld
      will be released on the Quest in Q1 2022.
