  - question: WHAT IS PATCHWORLD ?
    answer: Patch is a modular, immersive musical instrument environment made for
      Virtual Reality to code, create and connect your own instruments and sounds,
      and interact with them live with your body, your gestures, and other people.
      Our proprietary engine is written in C++ and we are using Unity 3D for the VR
      interface.

  - question: IS PATCHWORLD BRINGING THE FUTURE OF MUSIC VIDEO?
    answer: 'Music videos have been a popular medium for decades, but with the rise
      of streaming platforms and the increasing focus on individual songs rather than
      full albums, they have become less relevant in recent years. However, the emergence
      of virtual and augmented reality technology has opened up new possibilities
      for music creators to create immersive and interactive experiences that go beyond
      the traditional music video format. PatchWorld is a platform that allows users
      to create and experience these interactive XR music experiences, making it a
      potential game-changer for the future of music. By using PatchWorld, artists
      can create compelling Metaverse music videos that engage their audience in a
      new and innovative way. The potential for XR to revolutionize the music industry
      is vast, and PatchWorld is leading the charge in this exciting new frontier.

  - question: WHY USE VR TO MAKE MUSIC?
    answer: Patch lets you interact spatially with visuals and sonic interactions
      that respond to where you’re looking and how you move - a full-body, full-sensory
      experience with spatial audio. It’s an immersive, inventive world to explore,
      rather than just another rectangular editing interface.
