  content: Founded in 2020, PatchXR is a Swiss-Danish studio focused on SOUND & VISION
    in MIXED REALITIES. We have build our own VR sound engine for 5 years called Patcheetah
    and based on that we are now committed to developing broadly accessible, artistic,
    emotional and enriching experiences, and tools for creators of whole genre. Our
    team has worked in gaming, procedural audio and visual art for decades and our
    work has been exhibited in galeries, museums and festivals across the globe. Our
    ultimate goal is to enable a community of engineers and creators to come together
    in the Metaverse to foster the emergence of a new form of art that mix genres,
    realities and senses.
