  content: |
    PatchXR is a Swiss-Danish studio focused on sound and vision in mixed realities. We were founded in 2020, but our pedigree begins much earlier. Co-founder Mélodie Mousset is the creator of HanaHana, an award-winning surrealist VR artwork five years in the making celebrated by film festivals and the interactive circuit alike. A half-decade of development produced the core philosophy of our bespoke VR sound engine, Patcheetah. Eduardo Fouilloux had in parallel developed MuX, a sandbox for musical instrument creation available on Steam. They joined with developer Chris Heinrichs, creator of Enzien Audio’s ground-breaking compiler for the open modular environment Pure Data (Pd).

    This coming together of co-founders represents an unprecedented convergence of backgrounds in interactive sound and extended realities, all in a single vision of an accessible, emotionally powered new genre of tools and music.

    Your ideas and your creativity come first. That’s why our platform is built to be modular, to allow control both in high-level musical gestures and in low-level modularity. Your self-realization is essential. In our work, collaborations, and product, we value self-expression and creativity, quality over quantity, responsibility and autonomy, and spontaneity. We work to weave those ideals into our human interactions and into the mechanics of our tools.

    Creativity is at its smartest when you’re having fun. So this is a space of play, musically and visually - where we can build worlds together.

    More fun is smarter by design. We think spatial computing will change the way we make and experience self-expression, for games, creativity, and friends. So that means your most amazing musical creations depend on us making a community for you where you feel free.

    At the heart of this approach, PatchXR’s tools combine the best of musical instruments with gaming using building blocks native to extended realities (xR), across hardware and software. Those tools give users the feel of touching sound and musical structures, manipulating and sharing material with simple gestures - optimized for immersive media and fundamentally personal.
