  title1: WHAT’S PATCHATHON?
  section1: "Patchathon is a unique, hands-on format for exploring Patch, collaborating,
    and learning, which we’re touring with event partners. Invited artists get a singular
    experience in the metaverse.\n\nMake your own musical world in VR, then perform
    with it live online for an audience. Learn direct from the developers who built
    the Patch platform, hone your skills, and create amazing new work. "
  title2: WHAT'S PATCH?
  section2: 'Patch is a complete, immersive environment to create interactive music
    worlds and instruments in VR. As game engines disrupt the whole entertainment
    landscape, the PatchXR team is building a tool to enable DIY creators to express
    themselves in this new era. Get your hands on it and let''s start building the
    future of media together: blending sound, visuals, and full-body gestures in mixed
    realities.'
