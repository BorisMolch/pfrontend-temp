    content: PatchXR takes VR beyond passive consumption. This isn't a game with tons
      of guardrails and pre-defined paths. It's a toolbox, an open playground where
      you make your own rules. That blows the potential for musical imagination wide
      open.

    content: The future of technology will keep moving things forward into augmented,
      virtual, and mixed realities.  Music making in PatchXR with 3D audiovisual capabilities
      opens up new possibilities of creating immersive experiences for both virtual
      and real life. This will help produce 3D sonic environments and open new ways
      of creating physical installations with 3D audiovisuals.

    content: Patch has been one of the most incredible discoveries that I have experienced,
      as an architect and musician. The tool simply fulfills the dream of creating
      impossible worlds in which it is possible to compose music. The way we think
      about presence and virtuality is changing and those of us who use this environment
      are contributing to the emergence of new forms of art and questions regarding
      the body, performance and the hybrid haptic experience.
