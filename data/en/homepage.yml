    content: 'We tested PatchXR in 2020 and were totally seduced. It’s a real game
      changer that opens the world of music to extended reality. The intuitive VR
      tool integrates all the complexity of modular synthesis while engaging the body
      in a gestural experience that channels acoustic instruments: the field of possibilities
      is wide open!'

    content: PatchXR takes VR beyond passive consumption. This isn't a game with tons
      of guardrails and pre-defined paths. It's a toolbox, an open playground where
      you make your own rules. That blows the potential for musical imagination wide
      open.

    content: The future of technology will keep moving things forward into augmented,
      virtual, and mixed realities.  Music making in PatchXR with 3D audiovisual capabilities
      opens up new possibilities of creating immersive experiences for both virtual
      and real life. This will help produce 3D sonic environments and open new ways
      of creating physical installations with 3D audiovisuals.

    content: Patch has been one of the most incredible discoveries that I have made
      as an architect and musician. The tool simply fulfills the dream of creating
      impossible worlds in which it is possible to compose music. This environment
      is contributing to the emergence of new forms of art and questions regarding
      the body, performance and the hybrid haptic experience.

    content: 'PATCH XR is probably the most exciting instrument and music interface
      I was given to try in 2020. We came up with the fun idea to entangle digital
      and physical worlds in an instrument. Integrating compositions from Ableton
      live and interaction with Arduino devices over MAX/MSP worked seamlessly. I
      will definitely use PATCH XR to develop new ways to control and interpret my
      compositions in the future. '
