    summary: The best music software for VR, this will change music production forever.
      Period.
    content: 'You pretty much have your own music production studio here, but unlike
      many music apps on Quest, in this one you have every tool you need to make REAL
      quality music. You can do your own music show like a live or pre-recorded concert
      or you can literally just play around in a virtual music world and jam out.
      But here is where things get freaking crazy: Patchworld will let you custom
      EVERYTHING. Yes...you can import your own 3D objects, custom make instruments
      and create REAL music studio equipment and God knows what else. I''ve never
      seen an app do so many things and completely nail it.'

    summary: Dream come true for my classroom!
    content: Not only does this app have a great tutorial setup, but the tools are
      easy to learn and fun to record and share! I'm starting a new unit covering
      collaboration and this is definitely the app I'll use to show how to support
      each others ideas!

    summary: This is the most entertaining/comprehensive music making app I've played!
    content: |+
      It will have you lolling at the crazy funny characters. Who all sound like someone you would meet in a chill out room. Then there's the crazy but really useful and inspiring music making tools. The Bouncy Beat world will make you feel like you've just stepped into a 90s dreamscape flyer. I've only scraped the surface of this app but it has so much potential! The moment the free demo ended I immediately purchased the game, what a bargain !!

    summary: This app is amazing
    content: Coming from music programming (max, pure data) and composition, this
      app really allows me to take way further compositional ideas involving nime
      interaction, music information retrieval… Most importantly the community's extremely
      friendly and reactive.

    summary: You won't know how much fun making music in VR can be until you try it!
    content: Patch interacts from the very beginning; avatars show you around, demonstrate
      and teach you what you can do. There's no learning curve though, within minutes
      I found myself playing built-in sounds, and making new ones with just the mic
      in my headset. Recording a performance seems just as easy, and you can perform
      all the parts yourself on different instruments. That's just for starters, you
      can “world build” your own stage, too. Highly recommended!

    summary: I had no idea how powerful this thing is
    content: I purchased this app a few days ago, but I tried the free 30-minute version
      before that. During this half an hour, I watched only the first tutorial, and
      I liked it; quirky musical instruments, friendly atmosphere. But I was shocked
      when I bought the app and watched everything there. It was just the tip of the
      iceberg. This app is a powerful constructor that will allow you even to create
      your own instruments once you figure out how to do it. So far, I haven't had
      time to master everything there. There are a lot of possibilities. So grab it
      without hesitation. It's an incredible playground.

    summary: WOAHH
    content: This blew my mind right from the get go. It's the most immersive tutorial
      I've ever seen in any medium. I really felt like I was there hanging out with
      these weird alien dudes. So much personality! Anyway, it's not really a game,
      more like a engine for creating musical and visual experiences. There is nothing
      else like it and I can't wait to spend more time in it and make my own worlds.
      To the devs, you guys are awesome! I hope to see more of my new "friends" in
      the future!

    summary: Love this ! The new ableton integration
    content: The new ableton max4live device is a game changer. I can't believe I
      can send and receive commands from any OSC supporting platform. Super fun worlds
      to explore and it's possible to patch your own.

    summary: Wonderful instrument!
    content: I'm having too much fun recording my performances! Making some pretty
      insane instruments in this dreamy world. The 'drop' feature is amazing. I usually
      do VR seated, but this one has me dancing like crazy. Robust, performance ready
      beat machine. I highly recommend this musical fun-house!
  - name: 3dmusic
    date: 11/14/2022
    summary: Great for casual or advanced musicmakers
    content: Patchworld is an easy and fun way to create music for beginners, but
      allows experienced music creators to dig into the structure without limitations.
      It's like a Lego set for music in which you can create your own Lego pieces.
      Amazingly creative visuals make it completely immersive. I've tried them all,
      PatchWorld is the best!
  - name: PipyVR

    summary: One of the best games on Quest
    content: I was looking for a new way to experience music in VR, and PatchWorld
      is better than any other music game. The intuitive tools is easy to learn yet
      a professional way to creating sounds. And the tutorial system is one of the
      smartest idea I've ever seen, it's like there's a person in the world with you,
      guiding you through it. I haven't played VR games in a while that made me giddy
      with excitement, but I find a huge smile across my face as I bop and dance to
      a new beat I made. Best game on Quest!!!

    summary: The future of digital audio workstations
    content: If you make music, or just wish you could, this app is a must own with
      endless possibilities for the expert and newbie alike. At its core it's a playful
      digital audio workstation for making your own music in VR, but it adds to that
      both visual and spacial immersion that you can't experience anywhere else. The
      possibilities are endless and it's easy to get lost for hours in your own creativity
      and fun. The devs keep adding more and I can't wait to see where this goes!
