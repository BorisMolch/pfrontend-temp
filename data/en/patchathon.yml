  title1: WHAT IS THE PATCHATHON?
  section1: "Go from being a VR consumer to a creator, in an environment that’s fully
    musical and modular. Patch is a complete, immersive environment made for producing
    new music, sounds, and visuals and a new way of making music. And now you can
    join us in an intensive laboratory to learn Patch from the team that created it
    - then make your own unique VR instruments and performances to share with A MAZE.
    Berlin 2021. \n\nOne worldwide online lab will connect the Patch team, developers,
    technologists, and artists to venture into new dimensions. Beginning with boot-camp
    instruction and regular skills mini-workshops, the participants will work intensively
    in self-driven creative exploration, but with access to the developers and artists
    who built the Patch platform. \n\nAnd as the world presents both new chances for
    getting closer, our second Patchathon will focus on new ways of collaborating
    in hybrid spaces. That means a new focus on team creation and duo and multiplayer
    performance.\n\nThe end goal: make a wild performance project and play together,
    joining an evening hybrid-online as part of A MAZE.\n"
