  title1: WHAT IS THE PATCHATHON?
  section1: 'Beginning with boot-camp instruction and regular skills mini-workshops,
    the participants will work intensively in self-driven creative exploration, with
    direct access to the developers and artists who built the Patch platform. As we
    look forward to our world growing closer again, our second Patchathon will focus
    on new ways of collaborating in hybrid spaces. That means a new focus on team
    creation and duo and multiplayer performance. The end goal: make a wild performance
    project and play together, joining an evening hybrid-online as part of A MAZE.
