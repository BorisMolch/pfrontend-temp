# More about us

PatchXR is a team of experienced, quality driven music lovers and developers. Founded in 2020 and supported by Facebook Reality Labs, we are a team of 15 developers and artists based in Copenhagen and Zurich with an international team hailing from all over the world.

We are currently working on our first release PatchWorld, an advanced electronic music creation platform bundled with playful musical ‘EPs’ which are unique playful VR worlds that encourage play.

We’re best known for our work on MuX of which PatchWorld is a spiritual successor. Played by many music oriented VR enthusiasts, many Patchathons have been held where users try to make fantastic things using the tools available in PatchWorld.

Our close relationship with the community is a core feature of the studio’s philosophy. We’re proud of the way we get inspiration from users of our app and platform, our custom-built audio engine helps keep us versatile regarding the implementation of new features regarding music creation.

Our goal is to change the way we interact with computers and computer music by taking advantage of Extended Reality technologies. To get rid of the limitations of the screen, by replacing the clicking of a mouse for the gestures of the body and get sound touch and vision under one format.
