# More about us

PatchXR is a team of experienced, quality-driven music lovers and developers. Founded in 2020 and supported by Facebook Reality Labs, we are a team of 15 developers and artists based in Copenhagen and Zurich with an international team hailing from all over the world.

We are currently working on our first release PatchWorld, an advanced electronic music creation platform bundled with playful musical ‘EPs’ - unique VR worlds that encourage play.

We’re best known for our earlier work on MuX, a spiritual predecessor to PatchWorld. As our tools open up in limited beta, we've held intensive Patchathons in which users collaborate and make fantastical worlds using our platform.

Our close relationship with the community is a core feature of the studio’s but it's philosophy. We’re proud of the way we get inspiration from users of our app and platform. Our custom-built audio engine helps keep us versatile regarding the implementation of new features regarding music creation.

Our goal is to change the way we interact with computers and computer music by taking advantage of immersive and extended-reality technologies. The goal is to escape limitations of screen-mouse interactions and provide standardized ways of working with physical, full-body gestures, touch, sound, and vision.
