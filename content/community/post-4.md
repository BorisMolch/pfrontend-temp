description: Urchin is an ambient/trance/meditation music entity, that can be controlled
  by multiple users in a collective performance. It has spatial audio system that
  surrounds players. Each slider controls discrete feature of sound source. The tonal
  root of Urchin is 50Hz (it can be tuned to 60Hz as well) so it fits perfectly everyday
  electrical machine noise as additional masking background. Urchin can be edited
  to become self-controllable or driven by data streams like weather conditions, stock
  market values or brain waves.
