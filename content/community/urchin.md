description: "Urchin is an ambient/trance/meditation music entity, that can be controlled by multiple users in a collective performance. It has spatial audio system that surrounds players. Each slider controls discrete feature of sound source. The tonal root of Urchin is 50Hz (it can be tuned to 60Hz as well) so it fits perfectly everyday electrical machine noise as additional masking background. Urchin can be edited to become self-controllable or driven by data streams like weather conditions, stock market values or brain waves."
