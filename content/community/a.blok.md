description = "This performance is an interpretation of a poem by the Russian poet Alexander Blok. It dips you in the hopeless atmosphere of the poem with no escape. In general, the work is imbued with a sense of death, not only physical but also spiritual. Rebirth after death changes nothing, so the line between the worlds is blurred. After all, the whole world is a loop. The scene is self-directed with auditory accompaniment in the background. Each part of the poem triggers certain spatial feedback."
