description: In summer 2020, we wonâ€™t be able to travel where we hoped to. Instead,
  in Summer Festival we celebrate. Inspired by japanese summer festivals, we try to
  recreate the soundscape and visual themes of night markets and parades of traditional
  instruments such as taiko, nohkan, shamisen, sho and shakuhachi, etc. In this mysterious
  celebration along all these mechanical arms and knobs, will the mist finally clear
  out for a glimpse of fireworks?
bio: YenTing Lo is a jazz musician, singer-songwriter and producer and has so far
  released 2 albums of her own. Ferran is a programmer and game designer. They are
  currently working on the Off-Score Project, an interactive music album which explores
  new ways to invite players to listen to the lyrics and music through gameplay. They
  have also worked together on Pianobots, a musical puzzle game, and Jamsterdam, a
  scatting game featuring procedural jazz.
