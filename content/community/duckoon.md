description = "An exploration of the randomness level versus pleasing musical intervals in the Unity patch PatchXR (Patch World) during a one week hackathon (patchathon). Out Duckoon patch consists of a few oscilators, with combined saw, sine and triangle waves to build the basic sounds and a beat made with partially randomized samples, creating an immersive virtual instrument. Also there is a chord progression system with \"randomness\", allowed by music theory rules."
