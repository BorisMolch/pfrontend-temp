description = "The musical part of this patch is inspired by asynchronous beats and polyrhythmic patterns. It is made with a sequencer that uses the length of the samples by default to loop them around. With this in mind, we created audio samples with carefully trimmed timings that would start interacting with each other creating chaotic yet somehow organized pieces of music with overlaping rhythms that can capture brief moments of rhythmic clarity within a soundscape of aparent sonoric chaos."
