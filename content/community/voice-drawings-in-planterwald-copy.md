description = "We experimented with bringing the outside, both the natural and the physical, into Virtual Reality. In this scene, we imagined an electronic Audio/Visual musical instrument which is reacting to the user's voice. We explored melodic space to create an oniric but danceable environment user's can make music, relax or meditate in."
