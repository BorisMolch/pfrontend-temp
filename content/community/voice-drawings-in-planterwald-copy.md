description = "Starting from the universe of code possibilities, the programmers Malitzin Cortes aka CNDSD and Iv√°n Abreu channel their different creative explorations that range from architecture and sound art to the intersections between science and art. Together, generally a conversation full of digital poetics that is lived in constantly changing experiences defined as generative cinema.\n\nFor Mutek Mexico edition 17 they prepare 'Desierta', an intense display of live cinema coding of musical aesthetics that hybridizes introspective landscapes, noise glitch and intricate rhythms written live by CNDSD with graphics of 3D spaces intervened with generative animation, video synthesis in real time and expressive light control programmed by Abreu.\n\nDesierta has been created within a hybrid environment created in unity and implements the incredible work of sound creation and implementation of Patch XR"
