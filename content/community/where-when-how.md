description = "This experimentation is meant as an exploration of scale and intimacy. Although the video does convey the visual and sonic elements of the attempt, it doesn't quite capture the disturbing nature of seeing confusingly delicate sounds like noisy notes of flutes and very light pianos spinning organic planetoid sized shapes around and above you physically. The song itself is voluntarily slow paced, it leaves a lot of empty space to keep the experience imbalanced and fragile."
