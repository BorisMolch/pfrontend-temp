description = "This Patch scene explores the idea of rhythmic and harmonic relativity as a metaphor for the macro and the micro Universes. The scene is comprised of an 8 voice drum machine which can be used for creating endlessly evolving polyrhythms or, if you speed the time enough, it will create harmonics based on the same rhythmic patterns in the instrument. The visual component is made of AI generated 3D meshes and GAN synthesized visuals for the 360 environment."
