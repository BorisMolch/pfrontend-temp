description: "This piece features my own artwork (@steampunkCoffeeMachine). The images in the background and the animated 'Bazooka Megaphone' are all physical props that featured in several London Theatre productions. My soundscape features a security alarm inspired backing track with an epic gong that I just could not help bashing! then there was the feeble door buzzer sound. I do also give you a bit of a dance at about 1:30 into the track so thats worth waiting for!. I imagine this could be used as sound effects for a disaster movie where the gong warns of the approaching alien invasion while the hero is desperately trying to get someone to open their damn door and let them in."

I work in immersive theatre including You Me Bum Bum Train and Jeff Wayne's War of the Worlds Immersive VR Experience in London.
