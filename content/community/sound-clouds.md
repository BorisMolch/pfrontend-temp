bio = "Til Berg is a multidisciplinary artist who lives and works in Basel and Paris. He explores synesthetic relationships between particular fields, focusing on how analogue and digital technologies interfere with our vision and thinking about the artistic medium. Til Berg draws minimalist abstract forms and movements from music and sound with digital and traditional means. Most of all, he's curious. Just like you."

description = "Sound Clouds is a poetic space where speakers are moving and playing - a dream of mine in real life ! - controlled by the avatar, both to watch and to listen to, with a few samples triggered by a generative rhythm. I wanted to question on different levels the spatialization of sound and \"real\" movements in a VR environment, which is here an interesting issue and one that I will certainly explore more and more."
