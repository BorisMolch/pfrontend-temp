description: Carillon is produced by two artists who's sheer love of the instrument,
  the carillon, has brought this project into existence. The work uses a 3d scan of
  a cast bronze bell complete with photographic textures accurate to its real world
  surface. Our carillon is tuned to just intonation and we physically model foundry
  bells in order to create the sound.
bio: Commonolithic is an artist based in Montreal. He uses 3D scanning to explore
  the imaginative dimension of materiality; using virtual reality to offer embodied
  encounters of fabrication calling upon our imaginative capacity & how this is shaped
  by the material world we inhabit IRL/URL   instagram.com/commonolithic  Chris Wratt
