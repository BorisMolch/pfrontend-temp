description: We experimented with bringing the outside, both the natural and the physical,
  into Virtual Reality. In this scene, we imagined an electronic Audio/Visual musical
  instrument which is reacting to the user's voice. We explored melodic space to create
  an oniric but danceable environment user's can make music, relax or meditate in.
bio: SOUND OBSESSED is a Hybrid Arts Collective + Label of musicians working at the
  intersection of art, sound, science and emerging technologies. Obsessed with sound,
  artists explore new audio creation methods with fields such as robotics, data science,
  artificial intelligence, AR/VR/XR, and other new media. Our artists approach creativity
  with a strong focus on research and experimentation with new techniques while critiquing
  social implications and human-machine interactions.
