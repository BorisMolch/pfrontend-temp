description: Holofrenia is not a place. The Holophrenic term is a game derived from
  the word holography (h√≥los; 'whole') and schizophrenia (to split, fragment, or break
  the understanding, reason or mind). One of the oldest immersive technologies is
  dreams. The more time I spend inside VR, I wonder what it would be like to inhabit
  existence simply as an exponential sound evolving spatially for eternity...
