description = "Carillon is produced by two artists who's sheer love of the instrument, the carillon, has brought this project into existence. The work uses a 3d scan of a cast bronze bell complete with photographic textures accurate to its real world surface. Our carillon is tuned to just intonation and we physically model foundry bells in order to create the sound."
