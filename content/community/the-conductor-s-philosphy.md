description = "The artist aim was to make a serene sound installation space, without getting too bogged down in a complex signal flow. At the same time, I has been toying with making StyleGAN videos, doing a kind of AI scrapbooking from train rides and everyday scenes. He felt like these melty videos had a home in this little cave, accompanied by field recordings, vibraphone samples, and the occasional plinks of synthetic wires and pans."
