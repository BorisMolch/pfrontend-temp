#### A MAZE. 2021
 
##### PATCH & PLAY

## Go from being a VR consumer to a creator, in an environment that’s fully musical and modular. Patch is a complete, immersive environment made for producing new music, sounds, and visuals and a new way of making music. And now you can join us in an intensive laboratory to learn Patch from the team that created it - then make your own unique VR instruments and performances to share with A MAZE. Berlin 2021.

One worldwide online lab will connect the Patch team, developers, technologists, and artists to venture into new dimensions - both for experienced VR inventors and those curious to create inside VR for the first time. In this year’s second edition, we emphasize collaboration, partnership, and closeness - a chance to work with others to expand your knowledge and make something beyond what you can do on your own. 

Beginning with boot-camp instruction and regular skills mini-workshops, the participants will work intensively in self-driven creative exploration, but with access to the developers and artists who built the Patch platform. 

And as the world presents both new chances for getting closer, our second Patchathon will focus on new ways of collaborating in hybrid spaces. That means a new focus on team creation and duo and multiplayer performance.

**The end goal:** make a wild performance project and play together, joining an evening hybrid-online as part of A MAZE.
