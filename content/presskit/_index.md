# Description

Patchworld is a VR Music playground where you are a sonic traveller, exploring playing and building interactive sonic world in a ever-expanding metaverse.  

# History

**The foundation of PatchXR's VR audio engine was originally dreamed up by Eduardo Fouilloux at Animation Workshop in Viborg, Denmark. In 2017, he released a music game prototype called MUX which eventually became the groundwork for PatchXR ‘s philosophy and core technology of Patchworld.**

PatchWorld is a social VR music playground for everyone to play, build and share interactive music world in real-time. It allows users to discover the joy of real-time generated sound through an ever growing library of  fantastical musical worlds that are fully interactive and customizable. Thanks to our block-based approach, the game allows musicians and non-musicians alike to have fun and become creators of their own world. Through the patch platform, they can also socialize, collaborate, share their creations, ideas, follow and curate their favorite artists, worlds and patches, and soon jam with one another. The player is afforded the tools to create elaborate and stunningly beautiful VR Musical world and virtual machines in order to create the sounds they desire. This not only makes music creation fun and immersive but can provide a basic understanding of signal processing in a grounded and intuitive way.

Production has begun and the release date is set for Q1 2022.
