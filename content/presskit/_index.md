## Synopsis

PatchWorld empowers musical experience with marvelous worlds, fanciful instruments, and full-immersion live shows. It combines the visual experience and play of gaming with the emotional power of music. It’s ready to play from the moment you enter - but deep enough to let you build everything you can imagine.

## An unprecedented toolset

Play and explore fantastic musical worlds, even without previous musical experience - then get involved and remix to create your own. Join an underwater reggae jam, blast some hard techno beats, or make polyrhythms out of rainfall. Build your own reactive stages and sonic playgrounds – fully immersive, native on Meta Quest 2.

**EXPLORE** music experiences, stories, shows, virtual studios, interactive tutorials and a growing library of instruments created by artists around the globe.

**CREATE** your own musical worlds and instruments and record musicverse music videos and shows.

**SHARE** your creations with the world using built-in video recording - plus, coming soon, sharing with other users and multiplayer support.

For the first time, you can make rich, fully-customizable worlds without needing your own personal visual effects house - it’s like stepping inside a futuristic music video. You create for VR inside VR, meaning working in three dimensions is more intuitive. And since it’s all live and playable, you can perform, improvise, and jam. In an age when music makers’ vision can get lost in faceless streams, PatchWorld lets you express yourself and produce media for VR, live streams, and even live shows, with high-performance 3D visuals and spatial sound, even on just a standalone Oculus headset.

## Features

PatchWorld combines a playful interface with production-grade sound so that everyone gets a complete, rich musical experience. Want to explore music in an imaginative VR dreamworld? Check out interactive worlds. Want to stock your VR studio with your favorite techno instruments? You can do that, too.

**Features at launch:**

* Powerful studio-quality tools, including recreations of acid synthesizers, vintage drum machines, loopers, and chord synths - some made by our community patchers

* Use the mic to record samples or sing along
* Jam together with built-in bands and characters

We’re building a universe of music makers who can exchange and explore one another’s instruments, worlds, and unimaginable variety of creations. This community growth is already underway with artists and inventors testing the pre-release builds, plus a series of Patchathons at major international gaming festivals over the past two years.

## About PatchXR

PatchXR is a multinational studio blending unmatched experience in art, engineering, and sound and music for VR. The team has some of the world’s top talent in the emerging medium of immersive, generative, interactive music for full-sensory virtual reality. That lineage starts with co-founders Melodie Mousset and Eduardo Fouilloux, building on Melodie’s award-winning achievements in VR art and Eduardo’s pioneering work at Animation Studio Denmark and creating the music game prototype MuX.

Now, PatchXR has assembled a global team and a powerful, complete, ground-up engine for VR music, sound, and play. We’ve tested our tools with diverse artists from around the world in closed beta and our Patchathon collaborative experience at top festivals. With that bespoke foundation and world-class experience in multiplayer experience and tech, we’re envisioning new, futuristic ways to play together with music, engaging the full body with vision and sound.
