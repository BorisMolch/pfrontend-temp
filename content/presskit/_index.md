## Testimonials

“This is the future of music! Musical worlds you can inhabit, interact with and become a part of. A completely psychedelic, immersive experience. I love it!”

“This has blown my mind.

By far the most incredible, mind-bending, exciting, and entertaining experience I've had in VR.”

“This is the best app.

It works with Ableton Link and in multiplayer. It is fun as it is useful and complex. It is potentially a DAW and a multiplayer game at the same time. As a music producer, this is the best software I have used so far in Quest 2. And also the tutorial worlds are very well done and sooo immersive and psychedelic.”

“Easy to play, and SO much fun!

The guided experience is top-notch: I've put on PatchWorld for inexperienced VR users and kids, and they've all had a blast! The guide's humor is on point, the pre-loaded worlds are super immersive, and easy to modify like in a big sandbox…. .”

“The possibilities for collaborative music sessions across the globe would be enough to sell this app to me alone but add to that the world building, patching, and variety of tools available to you, and you have yourself not only a guaranteed good time with your friends (or strangers) but an excellent tool for music production, with an active and friendly discord community. The addition of DAW integration may well make this the future of VR music production, except it's here, right now.”
