## A new experience

PatchWorld makes you a sonic traveler in the metaverse of interactive music and sound, in environments transformed and expanded together by its players. Journeying in VR through this sensory audiovisual playground, you can explore, play, customize, build and share -- fully immersed in music and fantasy.

## An unprecedented toolset

PatchWorld is a social VR music playground for everyone to play, build, and share fantastic musical realms. It allows users to discover the joy of live-synthesized sound through an ever-growing library of imaginative components and full-featured “EPs” with endless possibilities for creation, customization, and casual and serious play.

Thanks to our block-based approach, musicians and non-musicians alike can realize what they imagine in fun and inventive ways. Uniquely scalable from casual music lover to advanced electronic music artist, the toolset makes stunningly beautiful visuals and rich sounds fun and immediately intuitive and fully native to immersive VR. With the connected Patch platform, players can also socialize, collaborate, share their creations, ideas, follow and curate their favorite artists, patches, and worlds, and soon jam with one another.

## Development
The foundation of PatchXR’s VR audio engine was first dreamed up by Eduardo Fouilloux at Animation Workshop in Viborg, Denmark. In 2017, he released a music game prototype called MuX that would become the groundwork for PatchXR’s philosophy and core technology of PatchWorld. He joined with co-founder Mélodie Mousset, award-winning VR artist, and Chris Heinrichs, a leading developer of interactive, generative, and modular music.

From those combined talents, a half-decade of development has produced our new-generation, bespoke VR sound engine, Patcheetah. With a growing team, breakneck evolution of the tools from engine to end-user experience, and input from leading artists and our collaborative Patchathons, we now unveil PatchWorld as our complete vision of creative, futuristic musical play and fun.

Production has begun and the release date is set for Q1 2022.
