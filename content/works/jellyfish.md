section1: SYNOPSIS
title1: ''
text1: "Dive into the watery depths of your consciousness in this mesmerizing, interactive
  virtual reality soundscape for the Oculus Quest, released in 2021. \n\nUsing your
  voice as input into the VR experience, glowing jellyfish and other ghostly marine
  creatures in this dreamlike underwater world beckon for your song."
section2: THE EXPERIENCE
title2: Sing with Jellyfish
text2: |-
  You find yourself immersed in a serene aquatic visual and sonic environment. In the distance, you notice fanciful marine life swimming around you. You gaze at one, and it approaches you.

  As you move your head and body, this jellyfish reveals itself as connected to you, mirroring your every movement. Speak to it and you hear your own voice transformed.

  With this vocal input, you engage in the environment. A jellyfish swarm echoes and loosely harmonizes your melody, so that you join in their chorus, triggering baby jellyfish spawning and other surprising chains of interactions. Lend your song to a different jellyfish, and discover a new character of transformation. Stay silent, and the jellyfish departs.

section3: FEATURES
title3: Bespoke technology for rich immersion
text3: |-
  Our tailor-made synthesizers are driven by real-time voice analysis of the singer, measuring pitch, amplitude, and even nuances like tonality and phrasing. These sonic inputs transform a wide gamut of immersive parameters - the surrounding soundscape, harmonic and rhythmic details, colors, animation, and spatial qualities.

  # Real-time voice analyzer

  * **Spatial Audio**

  * **Synesthesia**

  Drawing on a rich history of color/pitch synesthesia (and composers like Scriabin), each scale tone produces a distinct color, so a singer can visualize and control their tone as they vocalize.

  * **Synchronized clock**

  Rhythms are synced with one another at a shared tempo, strengthening the collective feeling of participation. With the soundscape pulsing away in time, multiplayer participants feel togetherness as they would in an experienced musical ensemble.

section4: EXHIBITION FORMATS
title4: Perfectly suited both for public spaces and home use.
text4: "**Simple presentation**\nThe Jellyfish is available for Oculus Quest and HTC
  Vive. It can also be shown in a private or public exhibition space as a continuous
  projection.\n\n\n**The “choir” multi-user presentation**\nA presentation with several
  visitors singing in the same space is a desirable possibility ; each one singing
  in a strange virtual choir, harmonizing with virtual non-human entities. \n\nA large-scale
  art installation is planned for production, featuring oversized, wraparound projection
  and walk-up-and-use headsets."
