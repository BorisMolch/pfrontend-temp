section1: SYNOPSIS
title1: ''
text1: "Dive into the watery depths of your consciousness in this mesmerizing, interactive

  voice as input into the VR experience, glowing jellyfish and other ghostly marine
  creatures in this dreamlike underwater world beckon for your song."
section2: THE EXPERIENCE
title2: Sing with Jellyfish
text2: |-
  You find yourself immersed in a serene aquatic visual and sonic environment. In the distance, you notice fanciful marine life swimming around you. You gaze at one, and it approaches you.

  As you move your head and body, this jellyfish reveals itself as connected to you, mirroring your every movement. Speak to it and you hear your own voice transformed.

  With this vocal input, you engage in the environment. A jellyfish swarm echoes and loosely harmonizes your melody, so that you join in their chorus, triggering baby jellyfish spawning and other surprising chains of interactions. Lend your song to a different jellyfish, and discover a new character of transformation. Stay silent, and the jellyfish departs.

section3: FEATURES
title3: Bespoke technology for rich immersion
text3: "Our tailor-made synthesizers are driven by real-time voice analysis of the
  singer, measuring pitch, amplitude, and even nuances like tonality and phrasing.
  These sonic inputs transform a wide gamut of immersive parameters - the surrounding
  soundscape, harmonic and rhythmic details, colors, animation, and spatial qualities.\n\n#
  Real-time voice analyzer\n\n* **Spatial Audio**\n\n \n\n \n\n* **Synestesis**\n\nOur
  system to \"sing colors\" attributes a different color to each note on the scale,
  allowing the singer to visualize her voice and control her tone.\n\n* **Synchronized
  Tempo clock**\n\nRhythmic elements are synchronized across all the headsets encouraging
  some togetherness to the choir of player. "

section4: EXHIBITION FORMATS
title4: A great piece for public spaces and homes
text4: "**Simple presentation**\nThe Jellyfish is available for Oculus Quest and HTC
  Vive and shown as a standing, still position in an private or public exhibition
  space. \n\n\n**The “choir” multi-user presentation**\nA presentation with several
  visitors singing in the same space is a desirable possibility ; each one singing
  in a strange virtual choir, harmonizing with virtual non-human entities. \n\nA large
  scale art installation is being planned for production,\nwhich feature a large scale
  projection surrounding headsets."
