  The Jellyfish is a VR experience for the Oculus Quest released in 2021. It invites audiences to dive into the deep water of their consciousness in a mesmerizing, interactive virtual reality soundscape.
  In a dream-like state underwater, players in a VR headset encounter ghostly marine creatures, glowing jellyfishes, beckoning for participants to sing through them.
section2: THE EXPERIENCE
title2: Sing with Jellyfish
text2: "You find yourself immersed in a serene aquatic soundscape. \nIn the distance,
  you notice a marine life, composed of what look like jellyfishes, swimming smoothly
  all around you. If you look at one of them, it comes closer to you.\n\nWith your
  gaze, you can connect with a jellyfish. By moving your head and your body, you understand
  that the jellyfish is acting like a mirror, following your every movement. If you
  talk to it, you hear your own voice transformed.\n\nThe jellyfishes and their environment
  react to your voice. A swarm of jellyfishes will start to echo and harmonize  with
  your voice in a loose melody, encouraging you to start singing with them. You will
  spawn baby jellyfishes and trigger rhythmic elements to accompany your chant.\n\nBy
  interacting with a different jellyfish, you will discover that it will transform
  your voice in a different way. If you remain silent again and ignore the jellyfish,
  he will swim away from you."

  synthesizers is driven by real-time voice analysis. measuring the immediate pitch
  amplitude, tonality and phrasing of the singer’s voice.This influence the surrounding
  soundscape affecting colors, animation, harmonic, rhythmic and spatial qualities.
  \n\n***Synestesis**\n\nOur system to \"sing colors\" attributes a different color
  to each note on the scale, allowing the singer to visualize her voice and control
  her tone.\n\n***Synchronized Tempo clock **\n\nRhythmic elements are synchronized
  across all the headsets encouraging some togetherness to the choir of player. "
