And where better than the international conference of musical futurism, Barcelona's SÓNAR+D, to show it off? Here's a sneak peak - and a chance to see it live and in person if you're at SÓNAR. "

Composer and sonic inventor Riccardo Ferri has already made a name as a stand-out innovator in the Patch community (where he goes by the handle Tigermaster). With his own deep-rooted history in electronic music - he's been a major name in record releases [back to 1994](https://www.discogs.com/artist/47582-Riccardo-Ferri?sort=year%2Casc&limit=25&type=Credits&filter_anv=0) - Patch is both a match for his technical imagination and experience and a way to play in new ways.

At SÓNAR+D, Riccardo will hook up two headsets that take you into his complete metaverse studio. Working entirely with Patch's own native tools, he's built four synths, two drum kits, a mixer, a snapshot manager, and even a virtual DJ deck - all entirely custom-made from scratch.

In a sure-to-be-smash-hit, you'll be able to try this yourself, with eight all-new patterns you can loop and play. It's the one part of SÓNAR where you're the headliner.

Just in case you can't make it to Barcelona this week, here's an advance look at his drum kit sequencer:
