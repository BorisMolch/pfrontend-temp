Patch's updates have been coming fast and furious, with two major releases in August. Now in Patch: everything from acid bass and kicks to light and particles visual parties.

We promised more was inbound, and we meant it. 

**August 1 update**

New at the start of the month, we unveiled a ton of new content, including powerful instruments for creating kicks and drums and acid TB-303 basslines, plus new mixing and looping capabilities:

* Fan - propels marbles when they pass in front of it
* Acidic - 303 replica
* KickBox - Kick drum synth + mini seq
* DrumBox - General drum synth + mini seq
* DirtBox - Clip distortion effect
* EchoBox - Delay effect
* MixBox - 4 channel stereo mixer
* Ghost Station - 4 channel ghost looper
* Background color - 3D background color picker
* Metronome - Metronome with global tempo control

Also in this release: improved ghost recording and looping, the ability to modify and save EPs (meaning you can use them to start your own projects), and numerous performance optimizations and fixes.
