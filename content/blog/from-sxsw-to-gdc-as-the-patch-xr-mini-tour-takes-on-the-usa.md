Our great American roadshow continues - we’re fresh off a ton of exciting SXSW experiences in Texas, and are now headed for an action-packed few days at San Francisco’s GDC.

We hit multiple showcases at SXSW:

The French AMA Cast Embassy  
Metaverse Mixer  
Villa Abertine at Dadageek

GDC will keep us even busier. The Big Dance is GDC at Moscone Center, of course. Find us in **Hall F at Booth N2903** for the full show, **March 22-25**, and stop by for a complete demo of the latest PatchWorld creations and to meet the team. We’re there as part of the SwissGames delegation, so this whole booth is don’t-miss.
