It's the studio where Pink Floyd recorded _The Dark Side of the Moon_. In recent years, it's been home to the likes of Sir Paul McCartney, Florence & the Machine, and Nile Rodgers. But in honor of Abbey Road's 90th anniversary, the landmark [Studio Three](https://www.abbeyroad.com/studio-three) venue plays host to the creative music technologies of tomorrow - including Patch XR.

Abbey Road Red are bringing the latest fun and cutting-edge tech to Studio Three for the Abbey Road Red Playroom, part of the Amplify Festival for the studio's 90th-anniversary celebration. We'll be there in person to show off Patch, joining an essential gathering with folks like _Sound on Sound_ _Magazine_, the STEMettes, media and academia, and tech innovators who are alumni of the Red program or friends of the Red crew. It's a chance to join us in intimate, select sessions for some quality time with us. And it's part of our ongoing relationships with leaders in music and technology.

What you can expect:

* **Meet our two co-founders**, award-winning artist MÃ©lodie Mousset and playful tech innovator Edo Fouilloux
* **Check out the latest capabilities** of our software and tools
* **Learn how you can create playful worlds** inside Patch
* **See new creations from across our worldwide community**, including recent Patchathon intensive creation labs and more collaborations

London, we can't wait to see you there. For everyone else, stay tuned here and on social media for more.

Happy 90th, Abbey Road!
