And what a round-up of projects, with Patch joining music creation finalists. That's amid other categories including marketing, gaming, live experiences, education, data, and distribution - the full music business spectrum.

This already puts Patch into Music Ally's Q3 Startups Report - a who's who in which we've been featured before. Now onto the last round, so wish us luck.

The project from Music Ally is in partnership with a terrific music network: Amazon Music, FUGA, PRS For Music, The Raine Group, Reed Smith, and Universal Music Group.

Check out the full range of innovative startups:

We're glad to be in such good company as we tell our story about creative play in the metaverse. Each category will have one jury-selected winner receiving additional support and mentorship, to be announced soon.
