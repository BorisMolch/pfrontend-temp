Thanks to all the work by our team and testers, we’re launching PatchWorld to the public. That means now all Meta Quest 2 users can discover our unprecedented VR toolkit for exploring musical experiences, building original, fanciful instruments, and playing full-immersion live shows.

Play and explore fantastic musical worlds, even without previous musical experience - then get involved and remix to create your own. Join an underwater reggae jam, blast some hard techno beats, or make polyrhythms out of rainfall. Build your own reactive stages and sonic playgrounds – fully immersive, native on Meta Quest 2.

**EXPLORE** musical experiences, including ready-to-play worlds to explore or remix.

**CREATE** your own musical worlds, instruments, and shows, complete with tutorials to show you how.

**SHARE** your creations with the world via built-in video recording - and tons more sharing and community features are still to come.

**Features at launch:**

* 3 unique ready-to-play worlds (“EPs”) to explore or remix and make your own
* Custom world creation with block-based creation
* 30+ instruments (with more coming soon)
* Whimsical sound toys like rubber duckies, beer bottles, skulls, frying pans, and more
* Powerful studio-quality tools, including recreations of acid synthesizers, vintage drum machines, loopers, and chord synths - some made by our community patchers
* Playable, physics-based sounds based on wind, rain, marbles, gravity, and more
* Use the mic to record samples or sing along
* Jam together with built-in bands and characters
* Customize your avatar
* 3D spatial audio and stereo mixing
* Record live performances in VR

**And more coming soon:**

* More worlds, more instruments, more visuals – with new weekly releases
* Publish your creations to share with friends
* Multiplayer live rooms for jamming, learning, and partying
* Custom-edited content and PatchMaker for building your own devices
* MIDI and OSC support
* ...and more customization and creation features
