Our pre-seed is off to a great start: we’re excited to welcome Serpentine Ventures to our investors.

Serpentine Ventures, a [firm](https://www.serpentine.vc/portfolio/) named for winding Alpine mountain roads, helps us deepen our strong ties to the Swiss innovation ecosystem. And SERV are betting on music in the metaverse. Let’s let them explain:

> Metaverse or rather in-game music event experiences have so far been reserved for high-profile artists only, e.g. Travis Scott and Ariana Grande in “Fortnite”. PatchXR enables all kinds of creators to host their own VR music events and therefore democratizes that market. Moreover, PatchXR brings unlimited instruments to users with its proprietary music engine, saving both money and space for aspiring musicians.
>
> Why did we invest in PatchXR? We believe that with the growing adoption of VR, this startup will become the go-to music platform in the metaverse. Further, we see high potential in the future marketplace, where one can trade instruments, concert tickets, and more.

Their investment enables us to add key hires to our team and accelerate our mission to create playful, borderless creation. We look forward to working with SERV - thanks for their trust and support.
