Each time we turn artists loose with Patch, surprises await. It's not only that each outcome can sound and look unique, it's that artists all find different things they want to say with the medium.

Our third international artist-driven Patchathon had as its background Nordic Games conference NG21 in Copenhagen. NG21 Autumn, like other events this year, had to go to a fully online format - but yet again the Patchathon was prepared to cross longitudes and latitudes, with participants this time spanning North and South America and Europe.
