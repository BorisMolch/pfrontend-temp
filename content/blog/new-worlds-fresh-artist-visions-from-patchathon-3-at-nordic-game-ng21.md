Each time we turn artists loose with Patch, surprises await. It's not only that each outcome can sound and look unique, it's that artists all find different things they want to say with the medium. There's a strict time limit - under a week to make these works - but unlimited possibilities.

Our third international artist-driven Patchathon had as its background Nordic Games conference NG21 in Copenhagen. NG21 Autumn, like other events this year, had to go to a fully online format. As in the previous two editions, the Patchathon was ready for that format, with artists spanning North and South America and Europe.
