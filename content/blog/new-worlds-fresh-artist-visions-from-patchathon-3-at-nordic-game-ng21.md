Each time we turn artists loose with Patch, surprises await. It's not only that each outcome can sound and look unique, it's that artists all find different things they want to say with the medium. There's a strict time limit - under a week to make these works - but unlimited possibilities.

Our third international artist-driven Patchathon had as its background Nordic Games conference NG21 in Copenhagen. NG21 Autumn, like other events this year, had to go to a fully online format. As in the previous two editions, the Patchathon was ready for virtual events, with artists spanning North and South America and Europe.

Patchathon often involves developers sharing a skill, then artists working to elaborate an etude based on that technique. In the poetic **_Pan to Pan_** by **Ze (Zongxian Huang)**, that's taken to an _nth_ extreme, with a fountain of literal frying pan objects placed as the sculptural centerpiece of an abstract world.

Ze chose pans; composer-developer-researcher **Phivos-Angelos Kollias** chose creepy floating babies. **Baby Machine **is intentionally "grotesque" according to its creator, plunging users into an eerie dreamscape with a soundtrack that ebbs and flows as you move through space.

Users come from a range of backgrounds and at a variety of stages in their development. **Tim Thompson** has decades of experience in intermedia with the likes of Bell Labs. For his Patchathon hack, he fused Patch with his own generative, analog video synthesis-style visual music system, Space Palette Pro. **PaletteXR** is just a first experiment, but it already recalls some of the history of video synthesis and demonstrates that Patch can be a control mechanism for other environments, too.
