For all the AI and automated cat flaps, once again, it's PatchWorld that gets attention. The Associated Press picked up Patch as one of their picks for the "most interesting" tech of the show. AP's wire report and [Getty Images](https://www.gettyimages.ie/search/2/image?events=776087715\&family=editorial\&page=10\&sort=newest) took Patch - and demo superstar Gad's iconic flower shirt - worldwide, from the UAE to the UK. 

The UK's mighty *Independent* has that full AP report (though outlets like *[Khaleej Times](https://www.khaleejtimes.com/business/ces-2024-updates-the-most-interesting-news-and-gadgets-from-techs-big-show)* picked it up, too):

Meanwhile, in the metaverse, Decentraland was once again treated to a [virtual party with Gad](https://decentraland.org/events/event/?id=90385953-056c-4cc8-b0ad-c34b46fb8e9b) (funded by their DAO through a grant proposal, even).
