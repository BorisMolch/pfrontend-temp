It's been leading this direction for a long time. After years of experience in audio engines and music VR, PatchWorld is the next leap forward. Due to release at the start of 2022 on Oculus Quest, PatchWorld takes all the musical powers of the Patch engine and opens them to musicians and non-musicians alike. And it's more social - so not only can you create your own custom instruments to play, but you can collaborate and play together, and share sounds and ideas, all with a powerful toolset.

So where better to show off where we're going than at GDC, the world-leading games event? Now, with the games industry still adapting to the pandemic, we aren't getting on a plane to San Francisco. But this year's online program promises to be essential to digital creatives worldwide. Thanks to being selected for the SwissGames Showcase 2021 mentorship program and Pro Helvetia, we'll be part of that program, and we can't wait to show PatchWorld and connect with others.

PatchWorld will incorporate rich musical environments we're calling EPs - as in music EPs. And after intensive months in development, we have some fantastical worlds for you to explore. Here's one short snippet, a fantasy jam under the sea:

So mark your calendars - if GDC isn't there already. The online event runs 19-23 July 2021. It's the full week-long event, but online.
