In the very newest update:

### New effects

**1-band EQ** insert for quick filtering applications.

**Shelf EQ** for scooping out high or low frequencies all at once.

**Compressor** for getting your sound as loud and punch as you need.

**Flanger** effect 

### New instrument

There’s also a new sampler keyboard with a granular looper onboard. Add your own sounds or record them from the mic, then play, warp, and mangle them live.

### New sequencer

A new melodic sequencer with arrangement capabilities means you can incorporate tunes and entire song structures into your VR songwriting. And if you’re stuck for ideas, it’s a way to play around and experiment, quickly spawning song starters.

### Build your own studio

Add these latest additions to our growing toybox of powerful production machines. Just in case you haven’t tried them yet, a reminder:

**808 MAYHAM**: A versatile drum machine inspired by the Japanese classic, with dynamic options for range and pitch and plenty of possibilities as you play the pads.

**Draw Board**: Use a laser to doodle in melodies by drawing - who needs keyboards?

**New shakers**: Hold and shake or move these around as you would an acoustic shaker. Try The Thing, Melodic, and Egg shakers - and see what happens as you move slowly or quickly.

**Home Grown sampler** to play bubbles in the mode of a beloved historic “vox synth.”

**Jangler polyphonic sampler**

**Ratchet Tiker hi-hat synth** (perfect for trap, drill, and more).

**New and updated Light Show devices**, including lamp light, spotlight, sunsets, world color, and more.

**Spawn portal** (as mentioned in our story on the last update): create portals to help players easily jump into multiplayer rooms.

With all those goodies to explore, what are we sitting around here looking at a boring screen for? Let’s head into PatchWorld and play. See you there.
