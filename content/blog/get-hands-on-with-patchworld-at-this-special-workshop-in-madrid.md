We're especially excited to be heading to L.E.V. - Laboratorio de Electr√≥nica Visual - this week. Madrid's event is one of the must-experience dates on the audiovisual calendar. We have a compelling backdrop, too, for the workshop - the exhibition [_Metaverses: Realities in Transition_](https://levfestival.com/22/en/lev-madrid/metaversos-realidades-en-transicion/) explores the possibilities of this emerging medium.

Since everyone gets their own Meta Quest 2 headset to use in the course of the workshop, space is limited, but you've got two passes for it on 10 December:

December 10th  
El Aulario, Matadero Madrid  
Hours: two passes, at 10.30am and at 4.30pm  
Duration of the workshop: 3 hours each pass  
Language: English  
Limited availability (10 attendants per workshop)
