It's our second-ever Patchathon - returning to the currently-virtual/hybrid A MAZE. Berlin international games and playful media festival. And we're all still basking in the glow of the work an incredible gathering of international artists produced. 

In just a period of a few days, these artists discovered Patch - some of them donning VR headsets for the first time in their lives - and build fantastic new instruments and environments. The goal: produce something that works as a live performance, and capture roughly 3 minutes of it live to share with the A MAZE. festival audience.

The results covered the full gamut of directions and imagination. There were reinterpretations of Russian poetry, evocative futuristic alien audiovisual etudes, ambient landscapes echoing with vocal performances, trippy bassline generators, four-player integrated ensembles with live coding interwoven with VR, and field-recorded videos and ephemera and 360-degree perspectives melded into the virtual.

Artists exploited everything in their training and background, collaborating with one another and our development team. Singers found ways of integrating vocals. Musicians looked for live performance interactions. Visual artists worked on workflows for importing 3D assets and working across media with music and sound. 

Patchathons are a chance to push the development and documentation teams, too. Each day's check-in on Discord invariably involved chatter between developers and artists, pushing new builds and deploying fixes and features, adding docs. And our team worked on new video tutorials, which we've shared online so you can explore, too. It's a rare chance to get a walkthrough directly from the folks who conceived and coded a lot of what you see shown.
