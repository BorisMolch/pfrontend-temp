There's nothing like the feeling of experiencing Patch first-hand. But don't take our word for it - here's a hands-on review. And get ready to play even more, as our friend  tig3rmast3r is back working on powerful new features in Patch, too. Recess is in session; let's hit the playground.

First up, xR/VR blogger Skarredghost of _The Ghost Howls_ visited us at Europe's ultra-hot immersive reality exhibition, Laval Virtual. We were one of their highlights. 

[Laval Virtual: Hands-On with CleverPoint and PatchXR](https://skarredghost.com/2022/04/27/laval-cleverpoint-patchxr-review/amp/)

Trying it in person, versus just seeing videos - "it really surprised me."

They were awestruck that everything is a patch, every patch is recordable - even the tutorial recording - and that the environment is both fully playful and fully modular.

And more:

> **I liked PatchXR because I’ve found it to be an amazing sandbox for creating artistic musical shows for indies.** It’s fun, easy to use, and its modularity makes it also very powerful. I’m sure that as soon as it will be out in the stores, music hobbyists will love it!

And speaking of music creators, part of what sold Skarredghost on the experience is what [tig3rmast3r](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGrKj0mHNOIWRmzvzI1zwGA) has been able to build. They're entire studios that are just as powerful as music pros use, but playful enough to be accessible to anyone, all inside VR.
