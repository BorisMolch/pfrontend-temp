It's all there for this event, now dubbed Immersive Tech Week. Organizers promise "VR, AR, Mixed Reality, metaverse and multiverses, NFTs, Web3, blockchain, virtual beings, digital twins, haptics, and more." It's the latest incarnation of VRdays Europe, which for years has been a don't-miss event. Everything's happening at the new venue, de Doelen, Schouwburgplein 50.
