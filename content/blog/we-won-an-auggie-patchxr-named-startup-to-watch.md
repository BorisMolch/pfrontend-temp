AWE's European edition was already a highlight for us. Then came the icing on the cake: PatchXR was given one of three Auggie Awards for Europe, complete with trophy. It's all thanks to Melodie's pitch in the pitch competition leading up to the juried nominations.

"Auggie" is short for AugmentedReality.org, and since 2010 has grown to be the AR/VR's single most-recognized prize. Our Auggie was awarded thanks to Patch's uniqueness, market opportunities, and the team's capabilities, according to the jury.

We're especially honored because of who was on the jury:

* Leading metaverse investor [Marco DeMiroz](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marcodemiroz/)
* Angel investor [Faye Maidment](https://www.linkedin.com/in/faye-maidment-12345069/)
* Istanbul-based [Cansu Çınar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cansu-cinar-05770696/) from Ludus Ventures

Since we couldn't be there in person, our great friend and advisor Muki accepted for us. But we were thoroughly impressed with all the competition - which also featured greater gender balance, with women represented as 5 out of 9 founders. Some of our other favorites - metaverse dating app [nevermet](https://www.nevermet.io/), and fashion enabler [Gnera](https://www.gn3ra.io/).

Ori Inbar, co-founder of AWE and Super Ventures, was not on the jury - but that meant he was free to just have fun with Patch, without any judging obligations. Ori writes:

> "I highly enjoyed making music in the app, and thought the big breakthrough was the onboarding experience with the funny, motivating, and super cool character in the application."

We really appreciate the vote of confidence! AWE was a blast - and watch this space.

Here's how AWE describes the award:
