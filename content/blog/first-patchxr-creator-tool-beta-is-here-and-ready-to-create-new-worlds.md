We're focused on Oculus Quest as we prepare for a planned summer release on that platform, but PC VR will also be available as part of the beta, via Rift S and Vive headsets. Sign up now, and we'll gradually be opening access - deliberately slowly, just to make sure we provide lots of high-quality, hands-on interaction with our team.
