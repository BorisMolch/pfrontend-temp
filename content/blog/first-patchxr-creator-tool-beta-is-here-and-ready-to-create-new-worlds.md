[Sign up](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSclGNupdrQz7q37WGlCtb5jzXghsnByTz56CC-kbPaXIeKOmw/viewform) for the beta; we'll gradually be opening access in smaller groups, just to make sure we provide lots of high-quality, hands-on interaction with our team. Register now and you'll be first in line.

We're focused on Oculus Quest as we prepare for a planned summer release on that platform, but PC VR will also be available as part of the beta, via Quest + link, Rift S and Vive headsets.

Artists have already been creating entire worlds and immersive experiences, tracks, and virtual venues using Patch. (If you've followed our Patchathon events at Amaze Festival and Nordic Game, you know all about that!) Here are just a few examples for inspiration, from creators Sinbiox and MOWUKIS + Savages:
