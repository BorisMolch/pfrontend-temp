It’s a global metaverse intensive lab. We’re excited to announce the participants of our second-ever Patchathon, returning to A MAZE. / Berlin in July!

An overwhelming number of people applied from across 22 countries; we’ve selected twenty-one artists and creators from 10 countries to join. They cover a full range of backgrounds, from 3D artists to composers, coder-musicians to media art researchers, VR experts and singer-producers, poets and teachers. They’re multidisciplinary, multi-talented, expressive, and we can’t wait to see what they’ll make.

But you don’t have to be left out. You can follow us on Twitch to watch exclusive tutorials on new Patch features throughout the whole program:
