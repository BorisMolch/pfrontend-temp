It’s a global metaverse intensive lab. We’re excited to announce the participants of our second-ever Patchathon, returning to A MAZE. / Berlin in July!

An overwhelming number of people applied from across 22 countries; we’ve selected twenty-one artists and creators from 10 countries to join. They cover a full range of backgrounds, from 3D artists to composers, coder-musicians to media art researchers, VR experts and singer-producers, poets and teachers. They’re multidisciplinary, multi-talented, expressive, and we can’t wait to see what they’ll make.

But you don’t have to be left out. You can join on Twitch to check out the latest Patch features:
