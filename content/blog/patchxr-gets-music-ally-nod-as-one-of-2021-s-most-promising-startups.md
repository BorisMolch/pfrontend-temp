PatchXR made Music Ally's third-quarter 2021 list, the "A to V of promising startups in 2021." And they're bullish on the state of that larger network as a whole, too:

> "The music technology startups of 2021 are part of a group that are driving notable change.**"**

They've traced us for some time as we've grown, starting with the "#NextStageChallenge," a "hackathon to identify tech projects capable of helping musicians through the pandemic."

Now they've caught up with us as a "fully-fledged startup, and one that chimes very well with 2021’s music/tech zeitgeist."

>
> Professional musicians can also use it to perform live. It’s currently in private beta, and we’re excited to see how its community develops.
