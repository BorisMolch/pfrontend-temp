On December 10th, PatchXR held a workshop at the exhibition "Metaverses: Realities in Transition" at Matadero Madrid as part of the LEV Festival.

The workshop, led by SUPER PATCHER Gad BARUSH Hinkis, provided an introduction to PatchWorld, our VR music platform that enables users to create and perform music in virtual reality.

With 10 metaQuest 2 devices, attendees with various backgrounds, including music producers and new media artists, were able to experiment with PatchWorld and discover the endless creative possibilities it offers for music production and live performance.

In this article, we will hear from two attendees of the workshop about their experiences with PatchWorld and their thoughts on the role of immersive technology in the future of music creation:

**Hi Latebris, thank you for joining the PatchWorld workshop and for sharing your thoughts with us. To start, can you tell us a little bit about yourself and your background ?**

Of course, I am an electronic music artist inspired by the cyberpunk world who seeks to experiment with the most cutting-edge technologies such as artificial intelligence, metaverse, etc.. in order to expand the limits of creativity and music production. I am also a sound engineer and a synthesizersâ€™ freak.

**What was your overall impression of PatchWorld after using it during the workshop? Were there any particular features or tools that stood out to you as particularly interesting or useful?**

It was a very amusing discovery for me. I really appreciate that there are devices in PatchWorld for all levels of music production. I'm not an experienced VR user, and it was very easy to start making music on PatchWorld. As I gained confidence with VR, there were also many patching devices for experienced music producers with which I could create my own synths.

**As someone with a background in sound engineering, how do you see PatchWorld fitting into your professional goals and interests? Do you think it has potential as a tool for creating immersive audio experiences, or do you see other areas where it could be particularly useful?**

PatchWorld has a lot of potential. I think it's a great environment to unleash creativity. You can add your own 3D spaces or create a mixed reality environment, and for me, it opens up many new music creation horizons because I can now create, for example, a mixed live setup with VR synths and hardware synths and this is amazing. I also really appreciate that PatchWorld has many programming synth options.

**What other software or hardware do you use for your music creation and how do you imagine integrating PatchWorld to your workflow? Do you see it as a complementary tool or as a standalone platform for music production and performance?**

My main setup is formed by Ableton Live with some hardware synths and a modular synth. I like the existent Ableton compatible devices in PatchWorld but i think it needs more compatibility work. I would love a full compatibility between Ableton and PatchWorld and so i can control my modular synth with VR.

**How do you see immersive technology, like PatchWorld, changing the way that we create and experience music in the future?**

I think this is just the beginning of many VR live sets that we will be able to enjoy in the future from anywhere in the world simultaneously as if you were right there. It will also be a great way to create music in spaces and with tools that don't exist in real life and that will inspire artists in new ways. I am sure this will give rise to new musical genres.

**Is there anything else you'd like to add or share with other creators about why they should try PatchWorld?**

I encourage all music producers, especially those who love live performance and synthesis to try PatchWorld because it is a the future of creation tools but already available today. It is amazing how you can create music in a much more tactile and sensory way, it's like your VSTs become hardware in your own room. I confess that PatchWorld is responsible for me buying a pair of VR glasses.
